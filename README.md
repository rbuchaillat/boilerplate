# Boilerplate Next.js

This boilerplate is a pre-configured starting point for Next.js projects, integrating a robust frontend and backend setup with a variety of tools and libraries to streamline development. Utilize `npm` to manage dependencies and run the project.

## üìã Recommendations

- **PostgreSQL Local Installation**: For development purposes, it is recommended to install PostgreSQL locally. This ensures faster development cycles and easier testing before deployment. Follow the official PostgreSQL documentation to install it on your machine.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
   cd boilerplate-nextjs
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
   npm install
```

4. **Run the development server:**

```bash
   npm run dev
```

## üîß Configuration

Before starting the server, ensure you set up your environment variables correctly:

1. **Create a `.env` File**:
   Copy the `.env.example` file provided in the repository and rename it to `.env`. This file contains template environment variables necessary for running the project.

2. **Authentication Secrets**:

   - For `AUTH_SECRET`, refer to the [AuthJS documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation#setup-environment) to generate a secure key.
   - This key is essential for securing your sessions and should be unique and private.

3. **OAuth Providers**:

   - To configure OAuth providers (like Google, Facebook, etc.), follow the steps detailed in the [AuthJS OAuth configuration guide](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/oauth).
   - Ensure you replace the placeholder keys in the `.env` file with the actual client IDs and client secrets provided by your OAuth providers.

4. **Run Prisma Migrate**

```bash
   npm run prisma:migrate:dev
```

These steps are crucial for setting up your authentication mechanism properly and ensuring that your application can manage user logins securely.

## üåê Frontend

- React.js & Next.js: Core frameworks for building the UI, utilizing server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- @shadcn/ui: A UI library providing pre-built components for a consistent and efficient design.
- Zustand: A minimalist state management library for managing state across components.
